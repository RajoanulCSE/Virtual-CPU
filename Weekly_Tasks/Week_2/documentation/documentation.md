The assembler works with the following instruction format:

    Opcode - A keyword that specifies the operation to be performed. Each opcode corresponds to a specific binary machine code value.
    Operands (Optional) - Currently, the assembler only supports instructions that don't have operands, but it can be expanded to handle operands such as registers or memory addresses in the future.

Available Instructions

The assembler recognizes the following instructions and their corresponding machine codes:
Assembly Instruction	Machine Code
ADD	0001
SUB	0010
LOAD	0100
STORE	1000
MOV	1100

Each instruction is mapped to a specific 4-bit machine code. For example:

    The instruction ADD corresponds to the machine code 0001.
    The instruction SUB corresponds to the machine code 0010.

How It Works

    Input: The program asks the user to enter an assembly instruction, such as ADD, SUB, LOAD, etc.
    Instruction Parsing: The program parses the instruction and looks up the opcode in a predefined set of machine codes.
    Machine Code Output: If the instruction is valid, the program outputs the corresponding machine code. If the instruction is not found, the program returns "Invalid instruction".

Example
Assembly Code:

ADD

Machine Code:

0001

Assembly Code:

SUB

Machine Code:

0010

C++ Code Overview

The C++ program uses a simple std::map to map assembly instructions to machine code. Here's a breakdown of the program's functionality:

    Map Setup: A map is created where each assembly instruction (like ADD, SUB, etc.) is associated with its machine code equivalent.
    Instruction Parsing: The program reads the assembly code input by the user, extracts the opcode, and looks it up in the map.
    Machine Code Output: If the instruction is found in the map, the corresponding machine code is returned. If not, the program outputs "Invalid instruction".

Limitations

    Currently, the assembler only supports a small set of instructions: ADD, SUB, LOAD, STORE, MOV.
    The assembler does not currently handle operands (e.g., registers or memory addresses), but this could be added in the future.

Future Improvements

    Operand Handling: Extend the assembler to support operands such as registers and memory addresses.
    Error Checking: Implement more robust error checking for invalid instructions and operands.
    Support for More Instructions: Add more complex instructions with multiple operands.

Conclusion

This simple assembler provides a basic foundation for converting assembly code to machine code in C++. The program is extensible and can be expanded to handle more complex instruction formats and operands.
